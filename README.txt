Donders Matlab Batch (DMB)

DESCRIPTION
An extension to the SPM matlab batch system, geared towards common practices at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, such as:
- Echo combination for multi-echo experiments
- Signal checks (e.g., spikes and stability) for fMRI data
- Nuisance regressors for data cleaning        

INSTALLATION
- NOTE: DMB requires SPM8 to be installed and in the matlab path
- Download locally
- Extract
- Add path to DMB to matlab path
- Start SPM and matlab batch
- The menu should be automatically add

USAGE
- Works exactly like the original matlab batch
- Look at the examples in the "examples" dir
- Note I included the items in the menus in the default sequential order
- Note also that the SPM functions (like realign: estimate, write, and new segment) are actually references to the SPM functions, included in this menu for convenience.
